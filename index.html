                        <p>
                            I've worked with many programming languages,
                            whether professionally, as part of my education, or
                            out of personal interest. These include
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Java, for controls applications, web services
                                and internal tools at Conserve It.</li>
                            <li>C for Linux kernel module development and toy
                                projects.</li>
                            <li>C++ for a JNI support framework.</li>
                            <li>Python, for build and utility scripts and
                                larger personal projects.</li>
                            <li>Rust, my main language for new projects and
                                for internal tools.</li>
                            <li>JavaScript, HTML, CSS as required for web-based
                                projects.</li>
                            <li>PHP, the primary language at Seen Technology.

                        <p>
                            I routinely try out new languages as I need them
                            for an application or just because I enjoy trying
                            out different programming paradigms. I feel
                            comfortable slipping into a new language as needed.

                            Other languages that I've touched on include
                            Haskell and Common Lisp.

                            Python, graduating to open robots where robots are

                            motors, sensors and 3D printed chassis. Students are
                            guided in building robots and developing software
                            for them, eventually participating in competitions.

                            concepts, assisted them in developing their
                            physical and software designs and helped out with
