                            slipping into a new language as needed.

                            Other languages that I've touched briefly include
                            Prolog and Haskell.

                            Python, graduating to open robots where robots are

                            motors, sensors and 3D printed chassis. Students are
                            guided in building robots and developing software for
                            them, eventually participating in competitions.
